**Introduction:**

Introduction: In 1987, Brooks [1] publish an essay ‘No Silver Bullet: Essence and Accidents of Software Engineering’, which proposes an influential perspective that there is not a single technological and management breakthrough can dramatically improve the software development. Brooks pinpoints two difficulties, namely essence and accidents. The essence difficult, such as complexity, conformity, changeability and invisibility, can not be eliminated by any approaches, while the accident difficult, such as inefficient programming languages, can be mitigated to some extent. In addition, he discussed the influence of past breakthroughs, such as high-level language and time-sharing techniques, and promising future tools, such as artificial intelligence and object-oriented languages. He believed these advancements are only capable of incrementally improving software engineer, instead of revolutionarily.
