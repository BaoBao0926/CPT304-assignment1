**Introduction:**

Introduction: In 1987, Brooks [1] publish an essay ‘No Silver Bullet: Essence and Accidents of Software Engineering’, which proposes an influential perspective that there is not a single technological and management breakthrough can dramatically improve the software development. Brooks pinpoints two difficulties, namely essence and accidents. The essence difficult, such as complexity, conformity, changeability and invisibility, can not be eliminated by any approaches, while the accident difficult, such as inefficient programming languages, can be mitigated to some extent. In addition, he discussed the influence of past breakthroughs, such as high-level language and time-sharing techniques, and promising future tools, such as artificial intelligence and object-oriented languages. He believed these advancements are only capable of incrementally improving software engineer, instead of revolutionarily.



**Identified Key Challenges:**



**Changeability:** Changeability is caused because 1) software engineering is a continuously evolving subject due to changing requirement, technologies and environments; 2) the physical machines on which the software systems are based may change, leading to the new requirement to change the implementation of software system. In addition to the challenge of changing itself, additional maintenance also poses a key challenge.

**Invisibility:** Obviously, software system is invisible. Architects can sue blueprints and hardware engineers can examine circuit diagrams, which are intuitively and straightforward to help understand. However, as for software system, there is not an ideal diagram that can clearly and easily represent the whole system. This forces software engineers to work with abstract constructs without any clearly visual and physical diagrams. Therefore, invisibility causes all engineer need to conduct abstract reasoning and development.



**Two Selected Design Pattern and Application:**


Brooks pointed out that the inherent properties of software development are complexity, conformity, changeability and invisibility. These features are difficult to address with a single technological breakthrough. Therefore, it is inevitable for engineers to solve these problems when developing software. Among all design patterns, builder pattern and adapter pattern can be used to overcome these inherent properties. The **builder pattern** can be used to solve the complexity and changeability of software development. The **adapter pattern** can be used to solve conformity and invisibility in software development.
